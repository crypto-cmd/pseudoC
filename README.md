# PseudoC (WIP)
### Have you always wanted to code in C but was too unexperienced with programming? Well have no fear, I have created PseudoC, a language so high-level it's basically a pseudocode.

### What is PseudoC?
PseudoC is a transpiled language that is meant to help beginners learn to code. It transpiles to C , therefore it is blazing fast.

### Why should I use PseudoC?
PseudoC looks extremely similar to pseudocode therefore it is very readable and easy to understand. It is also a language that is meant to be used as a guide for learning how to code.

### How do I use PseudoC?
1. Clone the repo.
2. Create a new file called `exe\main.pseudo` and write your code in it.
3. Run `node main` in the repo.
